excerpt: "I like to visit as much different conferences as I can get. This Autumn I had the pleasure to visit three conferences for my first time. This Blogpost will not contain epic recaps of these. Instead I try to share the atmosphere, recommend a few talks and maybe it could help you to decide wether JSconf, CSSconf and Fronteers are the Conferences of your choice (in case you haven’t been there)."

##CSSconf EU

CSSconf EU was a small, one day single track Conference focused on (guess what) CSS. You might think »How did they managed to fill a whole day with just CSS topics?«. I tell you that the organizers ([@kriesse](https://twitter.com/kriesse) and [@frontdevde](https://twitter.com/frontdevde)) did an awesome job selecting 11 damn interesting talks from CSS secrets over performance (»the critical path« and tools) to one almost psychological talk. Make sure to visit [the website](http://2014.cssconf.eu/) to see the full schedule.

I like the fact, that almost each and every talk was technical or at least had a practical orientation. There was definitely a lack of those purely inspiring / motivating kind of talks which was perfect for me.

###Highlights

My favorite talk which really blowed my mind was the one about **»CSS Performance Tooling«** by Addy Osmani ([@addyosmani](https://twitter.com/addyosmani)) which shows tools to handle the next level of performance optimization:

But the other performance related talk named **»CSS and the critical path«** from Patrick Hamman ([@patrickhamann](https://twitter.com/patrickhamann)) was also excellent and explained the »problem« with the »critical path« aka »above the fold« CSS in great detail. The video seems to be missing on YoutTube.

The third talk I like emphasize is the one about **»Styling and Animating Scalable Vector Graphics with CSS«** from Sara Soueidan ([@sarasoueidan](https://twitter.com/sarasoueidan)). It contains info about with the 6 (!) different SVG embedding techniques and the different approaches to style and animate SVGs among other useful things:

###Bottom Line

CSSconf EU was a banger and I hope I can make it to the 2015 version of it. The same goes to you: be there or be square!
