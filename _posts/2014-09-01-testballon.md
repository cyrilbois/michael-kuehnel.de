You'll find this post in your <code class="language-bash">_posts</code> `_posts` directory - edit this post and re-build (or run with the `-w` switch) to see your changes!
To add new posts, simply add a file in the <code class="language-bash">_posts</code> directory that follows the convention: YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

```javascript
/**
 * Bind custom event `overflowed`.
 * Fired when a element within the ribbon is overflowed.
 */
$(document).on('overflowed.kira.ribbon', function() {
	console.warn('overflowed!');
	$('#mm_mainTabContent').find('.mm_ribbonCloneOpener').show();
	//$ribbonCloneWrapper.attr('data-visible', 'true');
});
```
