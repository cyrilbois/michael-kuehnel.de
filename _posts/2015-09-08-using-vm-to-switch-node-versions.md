excerpt: "Sure you can just use homebrew to update your Node.js installation when there are new releases. Itâ€™s in fact very handy to do so. But beside the quirk when it comes to updating npm there is a method which makes switching Node.js version even easier. This became more important since the stable release of Node 4.0 which I like to use. But I have to be able to use a different Node version just in case thinks break with Node 4.0."
